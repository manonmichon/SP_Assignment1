<b> About the repository </b> 

This repository is created to store all the files needed to complete assignment 1 of the course 'scientific programming' (MSB1015), given by Egon Willighagen.

All the files can be found in the map: code.

The main file is "Michon_visualization.html". This file shows a figure as answer to the question "What is the number of genes per taxon?".
The other two files: "htmljs.template.html" and "wikidata.template.html" are the source code used for this project, and is kept here for archiving purposes. The file "wikidata.template.html" contains the first version of the query. The query request was later updated to also show the taxon names next to the codes.

<b> How to use this repository </b>

The main file "Michon_visualization.html" can be downloaded to a computer running any operating system. The file can be opened by calling it in the browser using its path, or by dubble clicking the file in the file explorer. The file will open in the default browser and should be able to run in any browser.

Please note that due to the time it takes to request the query from the wikidata server, the visualisation of the query takes a few moments.
